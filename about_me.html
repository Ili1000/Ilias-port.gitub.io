            <p>Hello, I am Ilias, a student with a strong interest in engineering and technology. </p>
            <p>I am particularly interested in how electrical systems actually work — from electronic circuits to combining hardware and software into functional systems. I enjoy working on projects where theory and real-world application come together.</p>
            <p>In addition to electronics, I use programming as a tool in my projects, for example to control systems, manage data flow, and present results. This website was built by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I also like to integrate CAD into my projects, especially when design and engineering overlap. You may come across some of these aspects throughout my work.</p>
            <p>I prefer learning by building, testing, and improving things myself. Currently, I am focused on further developing my technical skills in Electrical Engineering and am motivated to gain practical experience through projects, internships, or collaborations.</p>
